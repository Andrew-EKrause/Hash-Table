# *Hash Table*

## Description
**_Hash Table Data Structure Created using Java_** <br/>
The hash table is an important data structure that is often used for encrytpion purposes in modern programming. It is also used to gather and organize data. Hash tables often reduce the amount of time taken to access data given the various classes and functions invovled with the structure. To learn more about hash tables in Java, click the following link: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_hashtable_class.htm. The hash table included in this repository was created as a project for my Software Design III (CS 340) class at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse. I created my hash table using the Java programming language as well as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called Eclipse. In order to view this project, I would recommend installing the Eclipse IDE as well as Java if you do not already have these tools on your computer. If you wish simply to view the code, a simple text editor can be used. However, I would use an IDE such as Eclpse or Visual Studio Code given the amount of code in the project files.

**Resources for Project:**
- Java
- Eclipse (IDE)

# Running / Viewing the Project
## Eclipse (IDE)
1. First, make sure that you have the Eclipse IDE to run the program. If you need to download Eclipse, the link is provided below. <br/>
   -Eclipse (IDE) Download: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
2. Next, make sure that you have Java installed in your system. Go to your settings/system preferences and search for Java in your system. If you do not already have Java installed, follow the link below. The link will bring you to a website for downloading Java. The website will give you the option to download Java for Mac or Windows. <br/>
   -Java Download: https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html
3. On this repository page, go to the "Code" button and click the "Download Zip" option.
4. Go to your "Downloads" section on your computer and place the zip file in a folder/location other than "Downloads".
5. Double click on the zip file to open or "unzip" it so you can access the file contents.
6. HERE!!!Open up Eclipse, and type "Drawing" as the name of the workspace. Then click the "launch" button.
7. If any settings options appear, click the "Hide" option located in the upper righthand corner of the screen.
8. You should now see a workspace. You will probably NOT see any files. To get the actual file content into the workspace, click on the "Import projects" option.
9. Click the "General" dropdown arrow option. Then click "Projects from Folder or Archive". This should open a separate Eclipse window.
10. In the separate Eclipse window, select the "Directory..." button. This should open your file system window. In the file system window, navigate to the location where the "KrauseFirstDrawing" folder is stored. 
11. Select the "KrauseFirstDrawing" folder. Click "Open". This will add the path the the directory in the separate Eclipse window you have opened. 
12. Then in the separate Eclipse window, click "Finish".
13. Open the project folder that should now be in your workspace by double clicking it. Then open the "(default package)" folder by double clicking it.
14. Next, open the "Building.java" file by clicking it. Hit the green run icon, which is a green circle with a white triangle inside of it. The program should open a separate window with the drawing image.

## Command Line
1. First, make sure that you have your terminal open. Information about your terminal can be found here:<br/>
   -Mac: https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac<br/>
   -Windows: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/
2. Next, make sure that you have Java installed in your system. Go to your settings/system preferences (do this on your computer and not in your terminal) and search for Java in your system. If you do not already have Java installed, follow the link below. You will be brought to a website for downloading Java. The website will give you the option to download Java for Mac or Windows. <br/>
   -Java Download: https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html
3. On this repository page, go to the "Code" button and click the "Download Zip" option.
4. Go to your "Downloads" section on your computer and place the zip file in a folder/location other than "Downloads".
5. Double click on the zip file to open or "unzip" it so you can access the file contents.
6. HERE!!!In your opened terminal, navigate to the location where you opened the downloaded zip file and make sure you are first inside of the "Java-Drawing-master" folder and then inside of the "KrauseFirstDrawing" folder. (If you are unsure of command line commands, see the resources provided bellow.)<br/>
   -Linux and Max: http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html<br/>
   -Windows: https://blogs.umass.edu/Techbytes/2014/11/14/file-navigation-with-windows-command-prompt/
7. Inside the "KrauseFirstDrawing" folder on your terminal, type the following command: java Building.java.
8. After running the command in the previous step, a new window should open with the drawing image displayed.
